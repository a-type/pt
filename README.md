Welcome to your Verdant PWA!

This is a very opinionated starter aimed at getting you working on your idea on day 1, not fussing with tools or common setup.

It comes with a bunch of things out of the box. Some stuff you may not want to keep, but it should serve as a guide on what to build in replacement.

# ðŸ‘€ Your Checklist ðŸ‘€

Here's what you need to do before your app is ready to use:

- [ ] Edit `./packages/verdant/src/schema.ts` and add your first Verdant schema
- [ ] Run `pnpm generate` to generate the Verdant client
- [ ] Run `pnpm prisma migrate dev` to set up the database

Finally, run `pnpm dev` to start the API and PWA in parallel.
